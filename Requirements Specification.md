---

## 1  Introduction  

### 1.1  Purpose  
This document defines **what** the Country Flag Viewer web application must do from a user-visible perspective, including key user stories and acceptance criteria. Implementation details will be captured separately in the Design Document.

### 1.2  Scope  
The app is a lightweight, publicly accessible web page that lets a user enter the name (or common abbreviation) of a country and returns that country’s national flag as a high-quality image.

## 2  Overall Description  

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Target Users** | General public (age 7+) needing a quick visual of a national flag—e.g., students, teachers, trivia enthusiasts. |
| **Usage Context** | Desktop and mobile browsers with an active internet connection. |
| **Assumptions** | A free, publicly available flag data source exists and remains reachable; country list is based on ISO 3166-1. |
| **Dependencies** | External flag API or CDN; public DNS/HTTPS hosting. |

---

## 3  Functional Requirements  

| ID | Requirement |
|----|-------------|
| **FR-1** | The system SHALL present a single text input where the user can type a country name or 2-/3-letter ISO code. |
| **FR-2** | The system SHOULD trim leading/trailing whitespace and be case-insensitive. |
| **FR-3** | Upon submission, the system SHALL display the corresponding national flag image within ≤ 1.5 s in 90 % of cases. |
| **FR-4** | The system SHALL display an error message (“Country not found”) if the input does not match any supported country. |
| **FR-5** | The system SHALL allow the user to submit another country without page reload. |
| **FR-6** | The system MAY maintain a short history (last 5 queries) in the current session to let users reselect a previous flag. |
| **FR-7** | The system SHOULD provide alt-text describing each flag for screen readers (e.g., “Flag of Canada”). |

## 4  Non-Functional Requirements  

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Performance** | Mean time to first flag render ≤ 800 ms on a 10 Mbps connection. |
| **Availability** | 99 % monthly uptime. If the external flag API is unreachable, show a polite error banner. |
| **Accessibility** | Conform to WCAG 2.1 AA: keyboard navigation, sufficient color contrast, descriptive alt-text. |
| **Responsiveness** | Layout adapts to viewport widths ≥ 320 px without horizontal scrolling. |
| **Localization** | UI text in English; the input accepts English country names plus ISO codes. |
| **Security & Privacy** | Enforce HTTPS; collect no user-identifiable data; log only anonymous request metrics. |
| **Compliance** | No personal data means GDPR/CCPA do not apply; still honor standard cookie-consent banner if analytics added. |

---

## 5  Data Requirements  

| Item | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Data Source** | A public REST endpoint (e.g., REST Countries v3) or static CDN hosting SVG/PNG files. |
| **Data Freshness** | The system SHALL refresh its country list at least quarterly to capture geopolitical updates. |
| **Data Format** | Flag images MUST be delivered in SVG or PNG at ≥ 512 × 512 px, with fallback to 256 × 256 px. |

## 6  Error Handling & Messages  

| Scenario | User Feedback |
|----------|---------------|
| Invalid country name | Non-blocking inline message: “Country not found. Please check spelling or try ISO code (e.g., ‘DE’).” |
| Empty submission | Tooltip or message: “Please enter a country.” |
| API failure | Banner: “Sorry—flag service is temporarily unavailable. Try again later.” |

---

## 7  Constraints & Future Considerations  

* **C-1**  No user authentication or profiles.  
* **C-2**  Must run on modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) released within the last 3 years.  
* **F-1**  (Deferred) Support localized country names.  
* **F-2**  (Deferred) Option to download flag or copy embed link.
